# firstCode
i wrote this code when i was trying to come up with my final year project about a smart parking system where drivers log in and book a parking slot while still at home such that the congestio in the city is reduced as drivers without parking slots in the city are not allowed to park anywhere like alongside the roads, but later resorted to learning Laravel and abandoned this until i learn laravel and then transfer the code and the complete my project.
users file is the database for the final file which contains my work

eparking is what someone helping me out to learn laravel developed together with me though i did not particpate that much.
